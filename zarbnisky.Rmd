Based on the numbers/video above, we can see that your fastball actually plays insanely well up in the zone. Compared to the average MLB pitcher you generated a higher percentage of whiffs with the pitch and allowed significantly less damage.
<br>
However, despite this level of success only about 1/3rd of your fastballs have been located up there. With the excellent vertical break you are able to get with your fastball we need to be more comfortable attacking that part of the zone.
<br>
By attacking this portion of the zone more this will also help your breaking ball play up. The pitch could benefit from a few small tweaks which will help it perform even better.

# Pitch Comps
Using data since 2015, we were able to generate a list of the most similar pitches to your pitches as they currently stand based on a number of different factors. These include:

* Velocity
* Release Extension
* Release Height
* Movement Profile

![Fastball Locations - Johnson](johnson_fb.png)
<br>
While he is not a household name Pierce Johnson has been a solid MLB reliever. Upon his return from Japan, Johnson has posted elite strike-out rates. The main thing holding him back from elite overall performance has been a poor walk rate.
<br><br>
Johnson absolutely dominates the top half of the strike-zone with his fastball and it allows the pitch to generate a ton of swings and misses despite the relatively low velocity. His fastball also grades extremely well metrically. Your fastball is similar to his but the location is the biggest difference between him and you. Your goal should be to make your fastball heat map look similar to his.

# Pitch Design Focus
* Fastball we can continue to look to add velo and vertical movement but location matters more
<br>
* While curve grades out well similar curve balls are thrown by pitchers with less vertical fastball movement
<br>
* Main goal is going to be add depth to better align with the high vert fastball
<br>
* Change-up has solid comps in terms of pitch grades, however we need to lose velo (10 mph diff) and vertical movement
<br>

------

# Ideal Pitch Locations
<br>
We pulled the 1,000 most similar pitches thrown since 2015 and generated a heat map of the Swinging Strike Rate by location for those pitches most similar to yours. Additionally, we took the 500 most similar pitches that were put in play and built a heat map for barrels. If you are not familiar with barrels, it is a measure of ideal exit velocity/launch angle combinations. When determining where to focus on locating your pitches, refer to these heat maps.

# Overall Summary

## Pitch Locations

Based off the overall movement profile of your pitches here are what we believe are the areas you should be attacking with each of your pitches versus both left and right handed hitters. The green areas are location where you are likely to get a swing a miss than allow a barrel. The outlined green area is the whiff zone and the red outlined areas are the danger zones to avoid.

```{r final locations, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ff <- pitch_locations_value(pitches[1,"Pitch_Type"],pitches[1,"Velocity"],pitches[1,"Release_Extension"],pitches[1,"Release_Height"],pitches[1,"Horizontal_Movement"],pitches[1,"Vertical_Movement"],"L") +labs(title="Fastball v Left")

  sl,
  ch,
  ff_r,
  Sl_r,
  ch_r,
  nrow = 2,
  top = "",
  bottom = ""
)

```

## Final Notes

The overall key for you is focusing on throwing the fastball up. The pitch if located up in the zone can miss east/west its effective no matter the horizontal location if thrown up.

### Fastball

* Focus on velo and vertical break
<br>
* Attack the top part of the zone
<br>
* Don;t worry about leaving the fastball out over the plate

### Curve

* More depth will be your friend
<br>
* Needs to be thrown to the bottom of the zone but still within the width of the plate

### Change-up

* Movement profile is solid already but need to kill more vert
<br>
* Also need to throw it slower - 10 mph difference from fastball is goal
<br>
* Location consistency find a grip that you are comfortable throwing to the bottom of the zone
