Based on the numbers/video above, we can see that your fastball actually plays  well up in the zone. Compared to the average MLB pitcher you generated a higher percentage of whiffs with the pitch although it does tend to get hit a bit harder than the MLB average.
<br>
However, despite this level of success only about 1/3rd of your fastballs have been located up there. With the excellent vertical break you are able to get with your fastball we need to be more comfortable aggressive attacking this portion of the zone.
<br>
What we can see however is that a lot of your fastballs up are left over the heart of the plate which is a slight danger zone for pitches like yours. When attacking up we need to put more focus on keeping these fastballs away from the middle third of the strike zone.

# Pitch Comps
Using data since 2015, we were able to generate a list of the most similar pitches to your pitches as they currently stand based on a number of different factors. These include:

* Velocity
* Release Extension
* Release Height
* Movement Profile

# Ideal Pitch Locations
<br>
We pulled the 1,000 most similar pitches thrown since 2015 and generated a heat map of the Swinging Strike Rate by location for those pitches most similar to yours. Additionally, we took the 500 most similar pitches that were put in play and built a heat map for barrels. If you are not familiar with barrels, it is a measure of ideal exit velocity/launch angle combinations. When determining where to focus on locating your pitches, refer to these heat maps.

### Fastball Location Notes

* We need to attack the top of the zone more while keeping the pitch out of the middle portions of the zone
* Too often you throw fastballs in the barrel zone which seems to be a big reason why it can get hit hard

### Slider Location Notes

* The slider too often ends up in the zone
* The side of the place is great but we need to avoid backup sliders over the heart
* To maximize swing and miss we need to be able to throw the pitch just off the lower corner of the zone

# Overall Summary

## Pitch Locations

Based off the overall movement profile of your pitches here are what we believe are the areas you should be attacking with each of your pitches versus both left and right handed hitters. The green areas are location where you are likely to get a swing a miss than allow a barrel. The outlined green area is the whiff zone and the red outlined areas are the danger zones to avoid.

## Final Notes

The biggest thing we need to work on this offseason is pitch location. With all of your pitches the is a solid design framework but the pitches struggle at times due to location. 

### Fastball

* Always looking to add velocity
<br>
* Attack the top part of the zone
<br>
* Need to avoid the middle third of the plate more especially when attacking up

### Slider

* We need to add depth on the pitch
<br>
* Needs to be thrown to the bottom of the zone but still within the width of the plate

### Curve

* Design is great but the locations need to improve
<br>
* We need to be able to locate this in the lower third of the zone, this will improve your whiffs and will help to limit barrels

### Change-up

* Movement profile is solid already but need to kill some velocity - 10 mph difference from fastball is goal
<br>
* Location is solid but often it seems to get away from you staying up in the zone a bit more often than ideal
